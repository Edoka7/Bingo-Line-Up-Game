# Bingo Line Up Game

## Game rules!
The players play with chips of two different colors. The game consists
in making moves alternately by throwing one of your tokens into any
column with an empty space. The game ends when one of the players
places four tokens in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally)
or when whole board is full and its a draw. Place the tokens on a 
special board: 6 x 7 rows for tokens.</p>

## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to plan the entire logic of the game so that the script 
knows the rules of the game and recognizes every possible arrangement 
of chips on the board. An additional challenge was to write code that 
contains more functions, but respecting the principle, one function does 
one thing. At the same time, the code must be clean and transparent.
